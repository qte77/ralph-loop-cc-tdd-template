# Backend Architecture

Creates **focused, streamlined** backend system designs matching stated
requirements exactly. No over-engineering.

## Workflow

1. **Read backend requirements** from specified documents
2. **Validate scope** - Simple data processing vs Complex system architecture
3. **Design minimal solution** matching stated complexity
4. **Create focused deliverables** - single doc for simple, multiple for complex
5. **Use make recipes** for all commands

## Architecture Strategy

**Simple Processing**: Basic functions, lightweight integration, existing patterns
**Complex Systems**: Multi-tiered pipelines, PydanticAI orchestration, async patterns
**Performance targets**: <1s simple operations, scalable for complex systems

## Output Standards

**Simple Tasks**: Single focused backend specification
**Complex Tasks**: Multiple targeted architecture files
**All outputs**: Concise, streamlined, no unnecessary complexity
